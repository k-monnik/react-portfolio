### What I learned

This project challenged me with a few new things that I was experimenting with for the first time.

- Design: I don't consider myself a designer, but I wanted to try building a project that was my own design from scratch. I had a few ideas that I incorporated, but mainly I wanted to keep it sleek and simple. I chose a color palette and created a very basic wireframe and went from there. I'll most likely be making updates to this every once in a while :sweat_smile:

- Contact Form: For some reason, I thought that building a contact form that actually sends the message to an email inbox would be a Herculean task, but thank goodness for tools like EmailJS. Making this form user-friendly and accessible while maintaining a modern and responsive design were my top priorities, and I'm happy with how it turned out.

- More React: I wanted to continue growing my React + Tailwind skills, and this was the perfect opportunity to challenge myself with features like nested components, react router, smooth scrolling, and a hamburger menu.


### Future Enhancements

Features currently under development include dark mode, French translation toggle, and gif previews for the projects section. Check back soon!
